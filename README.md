# Alaska Legislative API

A typed javascript library for interacting with the Alaska Legislative API.

Will Muldoon's playground for working with this API: https://akleg.willmuldoon.com/

This isn't documented at all, and the API might change between releases.
But, this is pretty much typed correctly, so your IDE should give you
hints if you are using the API incorrectly.

You can copy-paste the `index.js` if that suits your needs, or install in a bundled
environment with `pnpm add alaska-legislative-api`

See [examples](examples/) for (messy, incomplete) examples.
